### Instructions to execute de code
You need to have Python installed on your computer to be able to run the code.

If you don't have the library **_prettytable_** you need to install the library with the following command:

**_pip install -U prettytable_**


#### For Windows
Excute de code using the command **_python Lexer.py code.xd_**
#### For Linux
Excute de code using the command **_python3 Lexer.py code.xd_**

**NOTE:** If you want to run a different string to test the compiler's operation, you need to edit the file _code.xd_
